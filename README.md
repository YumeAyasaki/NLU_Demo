# The demo:
- Data folder: Have the link to the dataset take from the Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification contest.
- Illu: The illu for some of the models. Using the TensorFlow.keras.utils.plot_models.
- Model: Our demo model, train on 50.000 sample with 10 epochs.
- utils: Some utility file, mostly for the demo.
- demo_g.ipynb: The notebook for running all models.
- demo.ipynb: The notebook for running only 1 model. Both of the notebook have a simple UI for customize the input.
